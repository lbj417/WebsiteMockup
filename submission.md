## Given more time, what would you have done differently?

- Styling tweaks, especially on the filterable content section
- Update webpack configuration to produce CSS files in the build
- Add tests

## Is there anything else you'd like to let us know?

- The first requirement was confusing because it says you cannot add any HTML elements. But obviously you have to add some HTML elements for the dropdown lists, etc.
- I used React components, but used the HTML templates from the EJS files.
